# Videris Connector Framework
This repository contains some examples adaptors that add new data sources to Videris via the Videris Connector Framework (VCF). 

These adaptors have been created and shared to help demonstrate the versitility of the VCF and how easy it is for you to create your own adaptors. The current selection of adaptors been written by 3rd party developers or by various members of Blackdot Solutions, who are not members of our development team but have some programming skills. 

As such, **these are not officially supported by Blackdot Solutions, they do fall under your Videris license agreement and are used at your own risk**.

The code is fully and freely available for you to:
 * review
 * learn from
 * adapt
 * deploy

To learn how the Videris Connector Framework works, and for help and tips with deploying and testing your adaptors, please see the [Videris Connector Framework Userguide](/docs/VCF_Guide.md).
