In August 2019, the company was also named in a lawsuit filed over ongoing opioid epidemic in Myrtle Beach, North Carolina that violated the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act, engaged in fraud, unjust enrichment, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and constructive fraud. In September 2019, it was accused by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission of discriminating against 178 female workers by paying less or denying promotions because of their gender. In 2020, it was named on the Maine Regulatory Licensing & Permitting Disciplinary Actions site. The company was also named on the California Air Resources Board list of Case Settlements. In 2018, it was named in a lawsuit filed for being engaged in deceptive acts and practices, false advertising, unjust enrichment and negligence among its seven causes of action. It was fined by the Chilean anti-trust court with $12.4 million for colluding to fix the price of fresh chicken. In 2014, Wal-Mart was sentenced to pay a $40 million criminal fine and an additional $20 million. In 2013, Wal-Mart agreed to pay $207,000 to cities and towns across the Commonwealth for overcharging public agencies for prescription drugs through the workers compensation insurance system. In 2011, Wal-Mart was fined $575,000 for fraudulently labeling 60 tons of ordinary pork as organic. In 2008, Wal-Mart agreed to pay $2.1 million and stop selling refrigerants that contain ozone-depleting substances for 20 violations of the Clean Air Act. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. was accused in 2006 of not having a program in place and failing to train its employees on proper hazardous waste management and disposal practices at the store level.
